Teleoperation Control of ROS-based Industrial Robot with EMG signals.

This System is used in ROS in Ubuntu environments (PC). Robot Arm with 6 DOF is controlled remotely using a EMG sensor. 
Robot arms and PC are connected, and the sensor is wirelessly connected to PC using a Bluetooth adapter. 
Using ROS-communication, arm movement data recognized by the sensor are sent to the robot arm.

The robot arm moves in the same direction as the human movement.
And a gripper is operated by a human hand gesture.
